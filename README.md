# hello-world
arjunsarode's hello-world repository on Github

My name is Arjun. I am a computer engineer by qualification. I graduated in 2008 with a Masters in Technology.

Although I did learn computer programming in college, I lost touch with it during the course of my career over the last 11 years, which took me in a different direction. I love technology, and I have always been associated with technology in some form during my career so far, but my functional expertise became sales and product management.

Earlier in July 2018, I decided to take a sabbatical from my job and re-evaluate the next steps for a career in entreprenuership. I want to build an SDK that provides excellent monetization to app developers. That's what I am working on now.

I came to Github to brush up my programming skills and also to learn new and exciting (and more relevant) technologies that will empower me to accomplish my entreprenuership objectives.
